We Build "Drona," addressing coding challenges in developing countries. Drona has three parts:

    1. Code Grabber: Snap and upload handwritten code to run it in a compiler.

    2. Question Bank: Crowdsourced questions for practice, reducing teacher workload.

    3. Opportunity Notifications: Stay updated on internships, scholarships, and more.

Drona simplifies coding education for all.
