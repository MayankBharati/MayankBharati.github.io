Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [IIIT, Allahabad](https://www.iiita.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2020-2024) with [8.33 Cgpa aggregate]().

I'm a passionate creator who loves to use my coding skills to make a positive impact. When I'm not immersed in the world of technology, I enjoy embarking on culinary adventures, tinkering with electronics, and occasionally indulging in underrated TV series.

My commitment to open source projects is unwavering, and I take pleasure in both building and contributing to these initiatives. Teaching and assisting others is a source of joy for me.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
